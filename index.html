            <p>Thanks for your interest in my thesis project! 
                I'll quickly describe the results of my thesis project and the preliminary results of my paper</p>
            <p>My thesis revolves around the improvement in predicting gross primary production and evapotranspiration considering the vegetation activity and root length.

           <h2>Background</h2>
           <p>Plant-atmosphere gas exchange occours at leaves level through small pores called stomata.
            When the stomata are open, CO<sub>2</sub> enters inside the leaves while H<sub>2</sub>O diffuses out.
            Due to the strong difference in water potential, for each CO<sub>2</sub> mole assimilated, plants lose hundreds of mole water. 
            For this reason, plant cannot store water and rely entirely on water stored in soil. 
            For comparison, for each oxygen mole that we breath we lose approxymately one mole of water, enabling us to store water in our body.
           </p>
           <p>When the water is scarce, plants need to carefully regulate the opening and closure of the stomata to prevent xylem embolsym, 
            the formation air bubble inside the water transport apparatus, which represent the first cause of plant mortality. 
            The increasing frequency of climates extremes and drougth events pose a severe treath in ecosystem balance and crop production,
            my project revolves around the understanding how plant behave towards drougth and non drougth events to face the incoming challenges linked to climate change.

           <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Evapotranspiration (ET) is the second largest water flux on land, accounting for 66% of land precipitation. 
                ET regulates the water and carbon cycles. When the soil is dry, plants close their stomata, thus limiting the CO2 assimilation. 
                Estimating ET correctly is important for water management, crop production, ecosystem balance and response to climate change. </p>
            <p> ET is higly variable in time and space and is influenced by mulitple factor including atmospheric conditions, soil morphology and vegetation activity.
                Simulating vegetation activity requires complex models and specific plant functional type (PFT) specific parameters. 
                While simulating ET, most of the global models do not consider the coupling of water and carbon cycles. 
                Carbon and water cycles are closely interconnected due to the double function of the stomata, whose opening and closure are influenced by both</p>
            <p>Soil properties are necessary to correctly capture the water availability of plants. 
                The water availability of plants at root zone level (S<sub>0</sub>) is given by the product of soil water holding capacity (WHC) and root length. 
                WHC is calculated based on the soil texture as the difference between the field soil capacity and the permanent wilting point. 
                Estimating the root length at global scale requires parametrization and knowledge of soil porosity and properties and different soil layers, which is often not feasible at global scale. 
                Using a data-driven remote sensing approach, we estimate the root length as the cumulative water deficit at which vegetation activity ceases.</p>
            <p>Here we simulate water and carbon cycle considering the vegetation to be always active using the Priestly-Taylor equation (PT) (ref.) 
                and explicitly considering the vegetation activity using the Penman-Monteith equation (PM) (ref.) at point-scale simulation against a network of eddy-covariance tower data called FLUXNET. 
                We also test the robustness of the model by simulating ET and GPP at catchment and global scale.</p>
           <h2>Method</h2>
           <p>To simulate ET and GPP we use the R package <a href="https://github.com/geco-bern/rsofun/tree/phydro"> rsofun </a></p>
           <p>We calibrate and run the model under three different setups:</p>
           <ul>
            <li>Using the PT equation and considering only the top 2 meters of root length</li>
            <li>Using the PM equation and considering only the top 2 meters of root length</li>
            <li>Using the PM equation and using the data-informed length</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We compared the model performance of the first and second setup to assess the impact of vegetation activity, 
            and the performance of the second and third setup to evaluate the effect of the corret represenation of root length. 
        </p>
        <p>We upscale the model simualtion at catchment level using data coming from US CARAVANS and on a global grid scale of 0.5 degree.</p>

           <p>figura</p>
           <p>The model is able to correctly simulate ET at yearly scale in most of the catchment. 
            It overestimates ET in grassland catchment, this is due to the fact that we use the wheighted average of canopy height, 
            therefore the presence of three, even in small quantitities, ...</p>
           <h3>Global scale simulation</h3>
           <p>figura</p>
           <p>The model is able to simulates ET and GPP correctly predicting the observed patterning, when we compared ET against FLUXNET, 
            our model have the same RMSE compared to the most important global model, the correlation of observed and predict ET at each tower flux is low compared to the other models,
            this is due to the fact that the canopy height is higly variable in space and the 0.5 degree resolution ... . 
            Using canopy height coming from FLUXNET data we simulates more precisely ET.</p>
